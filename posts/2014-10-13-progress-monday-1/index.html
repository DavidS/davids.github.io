    <p>Since coming back from vacation, my mondays were quite unstructured, as
customer’s mondays seem to be mainly occupied by working up whatever the
weekend whashed up. To get a better handle on these days, I’ve recently
installed the
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=personal.andreabasso.clearfocus">ClearFocus</a>
app to do a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing">timeboxing</a>. The
goal is to have a bit more of a structure when working alone and do not burn
through the day in a single go.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of (public)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodori</a> I did today.</p>

<h1 id="1-rails-admin-area">1. rails admin area</h1>

<p>According to the
<a href="https://github.com/DavidS/hrdb/tree/4cb3af2c08b50c8a93b2d26ed4cedbf8916c55d2/Templates/bootstrap-3.2.0-dist">designs</a>,
the <a href="https://github.com/DavidS/hrdb">hrdb app</a> has a separate administrative
area under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/admin</code> to keep those tasks separated from the common workflows.
I’ve
<a href="https://github.com/DavidS/hrdb/commit/4cb3af2c08b50c8a93b2d26ed4cedbf8916c55d2">started</a>
by moving all routes to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PeopleController</code> into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:admin</code>
<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#controller-namespaces-and-routing">scope</a>
and adding a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">admin#index</code> route to a separate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AdminController</code>. In the
<a href="https://github.com/DavidS/hrdb/blob/4cb3af2c08b50c8a93b2d26ed4cedbf8916c55d2/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb">application
layout</a>
I added a simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">menu_item</code> to the admin area as a placeholder.</p>

<p>Thanks to rails’ routing intelligence, the original “People” link still works
just fine, but now points to the new path.</p>

<p>I’ve used the second half of the pomodoro to investigate authorization
solutions. As the application will require multiple roles with different
authorization levels, I think
<a href="https://github.com/stffn/declarative_authorization">declarative_authorization</a>
will be a good match.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: I’ve not started a new pomodoro for writing this up, but spend quite a
while typing everything up and adding all the links. Need to be more careful
with that.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="2-ansible-and-salt">2. Ansible and Salt</h1>

<p>Motivated by <a href="https://plus.google.com/110443614427234590648/posts/629TDFGcCjt">Florian
Haas</a> I’ve
looked into <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> and <a href="http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/">Salt
Stack</a>. After spending most of the day
reading the docs, I’ve archieved a certain grasp of the workflow and
functionality of both systems. I’ve put some <a href="2014-10-13-progress-monday-2">notes on a separate
page</a> to make it available on <a href="http://www.planetpuppet.org/">Planet
Puppet</a> without the rails
and personal stuff from here.</p>
