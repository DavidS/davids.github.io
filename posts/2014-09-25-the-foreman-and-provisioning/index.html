The nasty detail is that everything still works, except for acknowledging the build success at the end. Discussing that on the foreman irc channel lead to my last comment on that bug report. Currently I’m leaning towards making the tokens infinite until the build is finished by having /unattended/built called. I might even be able to implement that, although Dominic said that that’s 1.7 material. So it’ll be a while until it reaches production." />
